    <p>  
        Butter chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani, is a popular Indian dish renowned for its rich and creamy flavor. Originating from Delhi, it consists of marinated chicken that is cooked in a spiced tomato-based curry, enriched with butter and cream. The dish is typically prepared with boneless chicken, which is first marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices like garam masala, ginger, garlic, and chili powder. The marinated chicken is then cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven) or grilled until it's partially cooked.

The sauce is made by simmering tomatoes, garlic, and cardamom into a puree, which is then mixed with butter, cream, and various spices, including fenugreek leaves. The partially cooked chicken is added to the sauce and simmered until fully cooked and tender. Butter chicken is often garnished with fresh cilantro and served with naan bread or rice, making it a beloved dish in Indian cuisine and worldwide..</p>
